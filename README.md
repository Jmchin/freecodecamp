# Freecodecamp

### Purpose
This repository serves as a central hub for all the work I have completed in the Freecodecamp course. Most of these projects are for practice while I train and hone my skills as a developer and a designer, and are not intended to be optimal solutions or implementations. Anyone browsing this repository is free to commit suggestions, and help me learn how to be the best developer that I can. Whether you are an expert, or a novice like me, I hope you can gain some insight by reading and critiquing my code.
